## 5G-based Link-level Integrated Sensing and Communication Simulator
    Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Link-level simulator (LLS)
    This simulator is a preliminary effort for the system-level platform:
    https://github.com/xds0112/5G_based_System_level_Integrated_Sensing_and_Communication_Simulator
    Used for testing key techniques and algorithms, and focuses on the communication physical (PHY) 
    layer modeling and radar signal processing procedures only.

    D.S. Xue, J.C. Wei, Y.G. Li, T.L. Zeng,
    Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education,
    Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,
    Beijing, PR China.


## MATLAB version and toolboxes required: 
    MATLAB R2021b or above,
    5G Toolbox, Phased Array System Toolbox.


## Main Features
    Link-level scenario generation (full downlink or TDD),
    Communication PHY layer modeling,
    Communication downlink and uplink signal processing,
    Sensing propagation channel modeling,
    Sensing detection and estimation


## Getting Started
    To simulate the full downlink ISAC scenario, run 'launchFullDownlinkSimulation' in the root directory,
    To simulate time division duplex (TDD) ISAC scenario,  run 'launchTimeDivisionDuplexSimulation' in the root directory,


## Documentation
    None at present.
